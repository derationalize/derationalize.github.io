<h2> This is a written documentation of my progress in making a roblox game!</h2>

<p> April 9th - I composed the general layout of my main project page, dividing the portions of my final project to organize it neatly. I also started working on downloading Roblox onto my school computer </p>

<p> April 11th - I completed the base platform website I will be displaying my project on, and began to write my "Why Roblox" section. I also began work on my actual game, as I downloaded Roblox Studio onto my desktop </p>

<p> April 16th - I just updated my photo documentation page to include some screenshots of the early designs for my game. I am planning on creating a find-the-button style game with different stages, but my plan will probably change! later today I will work on logging new updates about my game into my website </p>

<p> April 18th - I am becoming more in touch with Roblox Studio, which is the platform I am using to design my game. It is a little finicky, but I am getting the hang of it! I am getting into more neuances of designing specific objects in my Final Project. </p>

<p> April 24th - My project is coming along well so far! I have 2 stages and a spawn location as of now and I hopefully will be adding more things - I did a lot this week and I uploaded everything to my website. </p>

<p> May 9th - I have been designing a new stage for my game and soon I am going to implement it into Roblox Studio, for now I am just updating my website as I work. </p>

<p> May 11th - I created a new level that is an abandoned house, where you need to climb to the top of the building to find the button. </p>
