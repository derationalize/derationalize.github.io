<h2> Journal Entry (Sept 21) </h2>
<p>I have connected the local version of my website to the remote version via terminal code. When I put some code on the terminal everything I write and do will be published to the internet!  Here are the steps to upload my website online: </p>
<p>1) Go into terminal</p>
<p>2) Type in "cd ./desktop/derationalize.github.io" </p>
<p>3) Type in "git add ." </p>
<p>4) Type in "git commit -m "(update of what you just did)"" </p>
<p>5) Type in "git push" </p>
<p>6) Refresh your website!</p>

<h2> Journal Entry (Sept 26) </h2>
<p>Today we reviewed concepts from previous classes, and I changed the font of my journal - I also learned how to change the font on my website! </p>

<h2> Journal Entry (Oct 5) </h2>
<p>I was out from class today, but I made a lot of progress on my website, changing the design, adding different sections, and creating my name card! </p>

<h2> Journal Entry (Oct 12) </h2>
<p>Today we used javascript to access the console and we learned to track mouse clicks and keys pressed - things like that! I am going to try and incorperate that javascript into my code soon! </p>

<h2> Journal Entry (Oct 17)</h2>
<p>We took time in class to edit our websites and code our animation project. I finished the revisions I planned to make, including creating a back arrow for every page of the website and coding my animation project - my website is really starting to take shape now :) </p>

<h2> Journal Entry (Oct 26)</h2>
<p>In class we got an assignment that we had two weeks to complete - we had to code a jumpscare. I wanted my jumpscare to have an eerie vibe so I used an eye and made it watch you and follow you. I used a div of an eye and with javascript made a function so that it could expand when it was clicked on after changing the background image. From the event listener video, here are my questions:</p>
<p>1) What are all the ways event listeners can be used?</p>
<p>2) How exactly are variables used?</p>
<p>3) How can we use hex codes in the style of a div?</p>

<h2> Journal Entry (Nov 7) </h2>
<p>Functions enable javascript code to preform actions instead of building out the design of a webpage. Much of the head of an HTML page can actually be included in the body function. Functions can respond to many different inputs, such as a click or a key pressed - when they do you can have them preform virtually any command within the realm of code. I used functions to make my dessert project, and included stylistic variations within the function for my div!</p>

<h2> Journal Entry (Nov 16) </h2>
<p> I just finished my gratitude project! I made rats appear one by one after clicking on a div, I used functions in Javascript to do this! I had to work a lot with positioning and event listeners in order to make sure the rats would go to different spots every time the sewer grate was clicked :) </p>

<h2> Journal Entry (Nov 28) </h2>
<p>I had four questions about coding in general and I had them answered both by Ms. Josephs and ChatGPT. These are the responces I got! </p>
<p>What is an HTML Page? It is a file that is opened and used as a webpage. </p>
<p>What is an If statement? It is a feature of Javascript and you use it like a conditional function.</p>
<p>What are all the languages you can possibly use in an HTML code? There's loads, but some key ones are Python, Javascript, CSS, and others!</p>
<p>How do you have audio constantly playing in the background of a webpage in HTML? If you use a feature called an autoplay loop with an audio div then you can have it looping with some statements in javascript!</p>
