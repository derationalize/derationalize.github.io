<h2> Journal Entry (Sept 21) </h2>
<p>I have connected the local version of my website to the remote version via terminal code. When I put some code on the terminal everything I write and do will be published to the internet!  Here are the steps to upload my website online: </p>
<p>1) Go into terminal</p>
<p>2) Type in "cd ./desktop/derationalize.github.io" </p>
<p>3) Type in "git add ." </p>
<p>4) Type in "git commit -m "(update of what you just did)"" </p>
<p>5) Type in "git push" </p>
<p>6) Refresh your website!</p>

<h2> Journal Entry (Sept 26) </h2>
<p>Today we reviewed concepts from previous classes, and I changed the font of my journal - I also learned how to change the font on my website! </p>

<h2> Journal Entry (Oct 5) </h2>
<p>I was out from class today, but I made a lot of progress on my website, changing the design, adding different sections, and creating my name card! </p>

<h2> Journal Entry (Oct 12) </h2>
<p>Today we used javascript to access the console and we learned to track mouse clicks and keys pressed - things like that! I am going to try and incorperate that javascript into my code soon! </p>

<h2> Journal Entry (Oct 17)</h2>
<p>We took time in class to edit our websites and code our animation project. I finished the revisions I planned to make, including creating a back arrow for every page of the website and coding my animation project - my website is really starting to take shape now :) </p>
